# UML diagram generation from Code

The objective of the Mini Project was to generate a
UML diagram for a given Java source code file. The
UML diagram would be indicative of the features of the
Client code(attributes and behaviour) as well as those
pieces of code on which it depended(Inheritance,
Implementation of interfaces etc).
The data structure used for the implementation of the
UML generator is a Multi-List(Linked list in 2
Dimensions), with every node in the list representing a
different class that the executing program would
depend on.
The interaction of the user with the code will only be to
enter the names of files which are to be used for the
execution of the given program. The linked UML
diagram will appear on the GUI.
